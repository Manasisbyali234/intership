# Test Document Upload and Chat Flow

## Current Setup Status:
✅ Document upload extracts and stores content in MongoDB
✅ RAG service processes documents into searchable chunks  
✅ Chat queries documents using Hugging Face API
✅ Improved search matching for better question answering

## To Test:

### 1. Upload Document (http://localhost:3000/documents)
- Upload any PDF, DOCX, or TXT file
- System will extract all text content
- Content is stored in MongoDB with processed chunks

### 2. Ask Questions (http://localhost:3000/chat)
- Select uploaded document from sidebar
- Ask any question about the document content
- System will:
  - Search relevant chunks from document
  - Use Hugging Face API to generate answer
  - Show source citations

## Example Test:
1. Upload a PDF about "Database Management"
2. Go to chat, select the document
3. Ask: "What is normalization?"
4. Get answer based on actual PDF content

## Requirements:
- Add your HF_TOKEN to backend/.env
- Restart backend: `cd backend && npm start`
- Documents are automatically processed on upload
- No additional setup needed

The system now reads everything from uploaded files and answers questions based on the actual content.
